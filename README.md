High School Senior Capstone Project

VINE (Vehicular Injury Notifying Equipment) automatically notifies parents of any probable accidental injuries to the child and allows the parent to monitor the path and location of the child. VINE also includes a two-way communication system to enable communication between the parent and the child at all times. 

Each parent can use the VINE app on their Android cellular phone to monitor the collected data, including the GPS location of the child. VINE uses sensing technology to detect the bikeâ€™s steadiness, positioning, and acceleration. A two-way communication system, with an audio and visual alert system for the parent and a panic button for the child, is included to ensure ongoing communication between the parent and the child.
